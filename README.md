# health_pass19_reader



In this Repository there are scripts that allow you to create a qrcode, customize it and read it. 

I thought it would be nice to see this for outside events or to integrate it into my future projects.
Then I decided to read the information in the Health Pass 19 and I realised that the data is encoded. 
I have made some investigations and I found this website https://danstonpass.fr/# which explains the way to get readable our informations.
The website's repository is https://github.com/borisflesch/dans-ton-pass, it was done in javascript i preferred to do it in python.
